# Multithreading Starter Kit

Are you new to C++ and eager to dive into the world of multithreading? Our Multithreading Starter Kit is the perfect resource for you to grasp the fundamentals of working with threads and optimizing your workloads.

## What's Inside?

Inside our kit, you'll find a simple console application template, just like the one you get with Visual Studio. The difference? We've supercharged it by running everything on separate threads, intelligently splitting tasks across the available CPU cores. We've even thrown in some introductory game hacking content, covering both external and internal game hacking techniques.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with automated multithreading (includes custom CPU affinity support).
- Memory library for process attachment/detachment, read/write operations, and signature scanning.
- Threading library for managing threads efficiently.
- DLL injection methods, including loadlibrary and manualmap, with shellcode injection (please note that the shellcode is hardcoded).
- Logging system for tracking application activities.
- Overlay for drawing visuals on your application, supporting borderless and fullscreen windowed modes.
- Simple rendering functions for overlay graphics, such as lines, rectangles, and filled rectangles.
- Convenient function wrappers to simplify complex operations, catering to learners of all levels, including function pointers.

## What's Coming Next?

We have exciting updates in the pipeline for our Multithreading Starter Kit:

- Introduction of a simple driver communication method.
- Sharing a simple driver source code (note that it doesn't have a certificate, and some Windows security features may need to be adjusted).

We'll also provide examples to help you understand how these new features work.

## Is Anything Missing?

Please note that this kit is designed for educational purposes, ideal for school-like lessons. It serves as a foundational base for threading operations and isn't intended for complex workload distribution. Feel free to customize it according to your preferences and requirements. Your journey into multithreading starts here!
